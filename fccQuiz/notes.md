# Important pointers:
1. It is important to link each *input* to the corresponding *label* element. This provides assistive technology users with a visual reference to the input.
This is done by giving the label a for attribute, which contains the id of input.
2. Adding a placeholder might not be the best accessibility practice. Users too often confuse it with an already-entered value.
3. Input tag is always associated with label tags with for and id, input tags also have other attributes like name, type ---this is where you put the type of input and it adds a check, eg: text, email, date, etc.
4. The <fieldset> tag in HTML is used to group related elements within a form, while the <legend> tag provides a caption or title for the <fieldset> element.
   Together, they help organize and describe form controls for better structure and accessibility.
5.   <p>To display a &lt;div&gt; tag, you can write it like this:</p> 
6. Input tag value should be the same as the value that's inputted.
